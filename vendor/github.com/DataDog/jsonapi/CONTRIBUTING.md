Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## First Steps

Before contributing (via a Pull Request) we ask that contributors file an issue to start a conversation.

### Report A Bug

To report a bug, [create an issue](https://github.com/DataDog/jsonapi/issues/new/choose) and choose the `Bug Report` template.

### Request a Feature

To request a feature, [create an issue](https://github.com/DataDog/jsonapi/issues/new/choose) and choose the `Feature Request` template.

### General Question

To ask a general question, [create an issue](https://github.com/DataDog/jsonapi/issues/new/choose) and choose the `General Question` template.

## Contribute

We use [github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) to contribute to this project. This basically means:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Contribute your feature/fix (code, tests, docs) to your branch.
3. Open a [draft](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) pull request and ensure automated tests are passing.
4. Mark your draft as [ready for review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) and we'll review.

## Release

After pull requests are merged a maintainer will issue a new git tag that follows [semver](https://semver.org/). This will trigger an automated release and the new version will be available. Maintainers may choose to batch contributions if there are many actively being worked on.
