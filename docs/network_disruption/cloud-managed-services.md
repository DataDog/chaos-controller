# Network disruption: Specifying cloud managed services

## Why

Large cloud services providers are using wide IP ranges. Hostnames used to identify those services are resolving with some IPs of that range, and resolved IPs can change between each DNS request. Applying a network disruption using those hostnames only doesnâ€™t work well since retrying the resolution of such hostname would return new IPs (not disrupted) and the disruption would be ineffective.

Available cloud providers are:
- AWS
- GCP

### Cloud Provider Manager

The service will pull and parse the IP Ranges from the available cloud providers every x minutes/hours, defined in the chaos-controller configuration:

```
cloudProviders:
    pullInterval: "24h"
```

On the creation of the chaos pod, the chaos-controller will then use those ip ranges for the Network Disruption and transform it into a Host Network Disruption.

### Example


```
apiVersion: chaos.datadoghq.com/v1beta1
kind: Disruption
metadata:
  name: network-cloud
  namespace: chaos-demo
spec:
  level: pod
  selector:
    app: demo-cirl
  count: 1
  network:
    cloud:
      aws:
        - service: "S3"
          flow: "egress" # available are egress or ingress. Optional
          protocol: "tcp" # available are tcp or udp. Optional
          connState: "new"
      gcp:
        - service: "Google" # only service available for gcp
          flow: "egress" # available are egress or ingress. Optional
          protocol: "tcp" # available are tcp or udp. Optional
          connState: "new"
      datadog:
        - service: "api"
          flow: "egress" # available are egress or ingress. Optional
          protocol: "tcp" # available are tcp or udp. Optional
          connState: "new"
    delay: 1000 # delay (in milliseconds) to add to outgoing packets, 10% of jitter will be added by default
    delayJitter: 5 # (optional) add X % (1-100) of delay as jitter to delay (+- X% ms to original delay), defaults to 10%
```

## AWS

Available services are:
```
 DYNAMODB, ROUTE53, ROUTE53_RESOLVER, EBS, CODEBUILD, API_GATEWAY, WORKSPACES_GATEWAYS, EC2_INSTANCE_CONNECT, CHIME_VOICECONNECTOR, GLOBALACCELERATOR, CHIME_MEETINGS, CLOUDFRONT_ORIGIN_FACING, AMAZON_APPFLOW, KINESIS_VIDEO_STREAMS, EC2, CLOUDFRONT, ROUTE53_HEALTHCHECKS_PUBLISHING, CLOUD9, ROUTE53_HEALTHCHECKS, S3, AMAZON_CONNECT
```

We do not support using the service "AMAZON" (from the ip ranges file) as it's a combination of all ip ranges from all services and more miscellaneous ips; the number of ip ranges being too much from this, it's not possible for us to filter all of them at once.

We are using the URL **https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json** to pull all the IP Ranges of AWS.

## GCP

Available service is `Google`.

Google does not indicates which ip ranges correspond to which service in its ip ranges files.

We are using the URL **https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/goog.json**. This file is the generic Google ip ranges file. We could not use the Google Cloud specific file due to some ip ranges from the apis being in the first file (goog.json). ([More info here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10026322?hl=en))

### Datadog

Available services are:
```
 synthetics, orchestrator, process, global, logs, synthetics-private-locations, apm, webhooks, agents, api
```

We are using the URL **https://ip-ranges.datadoghq.com** to pull all the IP Ranges of Datadog.
