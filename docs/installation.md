# Chaos Controller Installation Guide

**NOTE:** Datadog engineers should consult Chaos Engineering team to deploy chaos-controller to a new cluster.**

## Requirements

Install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) before going further. It is required for the admission controller to get its own self-signed certificate.

## Install the manifests

## Customize the controller

### Leader election

### Delete-only mode

This flag can be enabled specifically on the controller configuration itself (through the arguments of its container). Once enabled, the controller in question will reject any incoming requests to create new injections for new disruptions. In this state, the controller will only accept requests to clean/remove disruptions. The controller must be restarted with the corresponding `--delete-only` argument in order to reach this state.

### Injector pods extra annotations

The injector pods spec is generated by the controller itself. You can add custom annotations to it by providing the `--injector-annotations` flag to the controller. For instance:

```
--injector-annotations "my-annotation.my-workspace.io/foo=bar" --injector-annotations "my-annotation.my-workspace.io/bar=baz"
```

### Injector pods service account

### Admission webhook
