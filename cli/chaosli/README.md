# Chaosli

The Chaos Controller CLI, `chaosli`, is meant to help create a more user friendly and digestible chaos-controller experience. The CLI pairs with your Disruption's definition, giving you information to give you a better sense of what is going on, and what will happen when you apply new disruptions. With features like explain and validation, it gives users, not only a better understanding, but a better experience with the controller.

#### Installation

Download the `chaosli` binary for your operating system and architecture [from the latest release](https://github.com/DataDog/chaos-controller/releases/latest).

#### Validate
---
Usage: `chaosli validate --path <path to disruption file>`

Description: Validates your disruption file (location defined by `--path`) to make sure everything is correctly formatted, and all options have valid configurations.

Example:

```
# Running Validate on a Configuration that has no Disruptions specified
# Note; We removed the network portion from the actual example for this example, normally
# network_delay.yaml in examples has a network disruption specified

$ chaosli validate --path=../examples/network_delay.yaml
Error: cannot apply an empty disruption - at least one of Network, DNS, DiskPressure, NodeFailure, ContainerFailure, CPUPressure fields is needed
```

#### Explain
---
Usage: `chaosli explain --path <path to disruption file>`

Description: Prints out a summary of the disruption (location defined by `--path`).

Example:

```
$ chaosli explain --path=../examples/network_delay.yaml
This Disruption...
=======================================================================================================================================
üß∞ has the following metadata  ...
	‚ÑπÔ∏è  has DryRun set to false meaning this disruption WILL run.
	‚ÑπÔ∏è  will be run on the Pod level, so everything in this disruption is scoped at this level.
	‚ÑπÔ∏è  has the following selectors which will be used to target pods
		üéØ  app=demo-curl
	‚ÑπÔ∏è  is going to target 1 pod(s) (either described as a percentage of total pods or actual number of them).
=======================================================================================================================================
üíâ injects a network disruption ...
	üí• applies network failures on outgoing traffic.
		üí£ applies a packet delay of 1000 ms.
			üí£ applies a jitter of 1000 ms to the delay value to add randomness to the delay.

#### Creation
---
Usage: `chaosli create --path <path to output generated disruption file>`

Description: User friendly input process that helps you create your disruptions from scratch answering simple questions.

#### Context
---
Usage: `chaosli context --path <path to disruption file>`

Description: Gives you context of the targets you intend to disrupt. Shares information regarding status of pods, containers, and nodes. Shares information regarding the state of pods, containers, and nodes as well. 

#### Testing Locally
Run `go run chaosli/main.go context --path <path to disruption file>`
