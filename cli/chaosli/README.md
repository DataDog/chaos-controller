# ChaosCLI

The ChaosCLI is motivated by creating a more user friendly and digestible chaos-controller experience. The CLI pairs with your Disruption configuration, giving you information to give you a better sense of what is going on or what will happen when you apply new disruptions. With features like explain and validation, it gives users, not only a better understanding, but a better experience with the controller.

#### Validate
---
Usage: `go run chaosli/main.go validate --path <path to disruption file>`

Description: Validates your disruption files to make sure everything is correctly formatted.

Example:

```
# Running Validate on a Configuration that has no Disruptions specified
# Note; We removed the network portion from the actual example for this example, normally
# network_delay.yaml in examples has a network disruption specified

$ go run chaosli/main.go validate --path=../examples/network_delay.yaml
Error: cannot apply an empty disruption - at least one of Network, DNS, DiskPressure, NodeFailure, CPUPressure fields is needed
```

#### Explain
---
Usage: `go run chaosli/main.go explain --path <path to disruption file>`

Description: Prints out a summary of the disruption defined by `path`.

Example:

```
$ go run chaosli/main.go explain --path=../examples/network_delay.yaml
This Disruption...
=======================================================================================================================================
üß∞ has the following metadata  ...
	‚ÑπÔ∏è  has DryRun set to false meaning this disruption WILL run.
	‚ÑπÔ∏è  will be run on the Pod level, so everything in this disruption is scoped at this level.
	‚ÑπÔ∏è  has the following selectors which will be used to target pods
		üéØ  app=demo-curl
	‚ÑπÔ∏è  is going to target 1 pod(s) (either described as a percentage of total pods or actual number of them).
=======================================================================================================================================
üíâ injects a network disruption ...
	üí• applies network failures on outgoing traffic.
		üí£ applies a packet delay of 1000 ms.
			üí£ applies a jitter of 1000 ms to the delay value to add randomness to the delay.

#### Creation
---
Usage: `go run chaosli/main.go create --path <path of new disruption file>`

Description: User friendly input process that helps you create your disruptions from scratch answering simple questions.
