## Testing the controller locally

More extensive documentation about testing can be found in the testing [docs](docs/testing.md)

### Quick start

Install the [required](docs/testing.md#requirements) requirements for this project first.

If you want to test the controller locally (without having to redeploy a new image on a staging cluster), please use the [minikube project](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/) as described below:

* start minikube with containerd engine
  * `make minikube-start`
* build the new image of the controller with your local changes
  * `make docker-build`
* deploy the CRD and the controller on the minikube cluster
  * `make install && make deploy`

If the controller is already deployed, you'll have to remove the running pod for changes to be applied.

**Known issue: the pod preset injecting the fake Datadog statsd environment variable is created at the end of the apply. The preset may not be applied on the chaos controller pod, making it to panic. If it's the case, you have to remove the pod so it's created again with the pod preset."**

The [samples](config/samples) contains sample data which can be used to test your changes.

* [deployment.yaml](config/samples/deployment.yaml) contains a simple container which can be used for testing
* [chaos_v1beta1_disruption.yaml](config/samples/chaos_v1beta1_disruption.yaml) contains a Disruption resource. Feel free to comment out want you don't need.

Both samples can be applied using kubectl: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.

### Minikube ISO

We need some specific kernel modules to be enabled to do some of the injections. Because some of them were not enabled by default in the ISO, we built a custom one following the [official guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/iso/) which is stored in the [minikube/iso] directory.

## Re-generating the CRD manifest

When the API package is changed, the CRD (custom resource definition) must be re-generated. To achieve that, just run the `make manifests` command.

## 3rd-party licenses

3rd-party references and licenses are kept in the [LICENSE-3rdparty.csv](LICENSE-3rdparty.csv) file. This file has been generated by the [tasks/3rdparty.py](tasks/3rdparty.py) script. If any vendor is updated, added or removed, this file must be updated as well.

## Available commands

### Running, installing & generating

* `make deploy`: deploy the controller in the configured Kubernetes cluster in ~/.kube/config
* `make generate`: generate boilerplate code.
* `make install`: install CRDs into a cluster
* `make manifests`: generate manifests e.g. CRD, RBAC etc.
* `make run`: run against the configured Kubernetes cluster in ~/.kube/config
* `make uninstall`: uninstall CRDs from a cluster

### Building

* `make docker-build`: build both images and load them into minikube
  * `make docker-build-injector`: build the injector image and load it into minikube
  * `make docker-build-manager`: build the manager image and load it into minikube
* `make injector`: build injector binary
* `make manager`: build manager binary
* `make minikube-start`: start minikube with our ISO and containerd runtime

### Testing, checking & linting

* `make fmt`: run go fmt against the codebase.
* `make header-check`: check all files if they contain the correct header.
* `make license-check`: check if all third party modules contain a license and build the license database.
* `make lint`: run golangci-lint against codebase.
* `make test`: run tests
* `make vet`: run go vet against the codebase.
